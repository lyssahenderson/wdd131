        <h2>What Makes Us, Us!</h2>
        <p>Simple Cooking was originally designed as a final project for a college course, but has now become something more! Now we get to use this site to share our creations with so many people that we didn't know before!</p>
        <h2>Where Our Recipes Come From</h2>
        <p>These recipes have come from so many different people, at so many different points of our lives! There are recipes in here that have just been discovered, and some in here that have been through generations! We love them all dearly and hope to continue to add more and more as we keep discovering new recipes!</p>
        <h2>What We Hope You Learn</h2>
        <p>The hope for this site is that you will find something new that you enjoy! It's as simple as that!</p>
